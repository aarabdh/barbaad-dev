I have waited for this day 
The day after yesterday 
The day before tomorrow.

Everything is perfect. 
We are sitting on the park bench 
I help you up on the feet 
Your curls would sway in the wind 
If you still had them.

It is a quiet day of winter.

I drop to a knee, and you gasp 
I cannot, will not look up 
I fumble with the ring 
But then I say, 
"Will you marry me?"

"But—" 
"I know." 
"What abo—" 
"We'll make do." 
"Are you sure?" you ask

Am I? 
I grip your frail hands 
I have never been more sure 
I slip the ring on your finger.

And it slips back out. 
Our guffaw is unanimous 
The ring had been ordered an year ago 
You were... more, back then.

Even still, I grope around in the grass 
The ring will not slip this time 
Our intertwined hands won't allow it.

We watch the sun peak through the trees 
Watch the world wake up 
If only this winter could last forever.
