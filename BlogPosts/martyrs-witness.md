The snow was black, the rocks were red 
The gear was heavy, the gun half empty 
The rolling valleys saw your strength 
As did we

The winds carry the smell of home 
The flavour of chilly, the softness of roti 
Your empty plate felt your sorrow 
As did we

The bulky bunks feel too cramped 
Your bed is cold, your toes colder 
The open windows heard your shivers 
As did we

The days have turned into warmer nights 
Your breath freezes, your heart shouts 
Your friend held your hand 
As did we

The blood boils against the tyranny of cold 
The fingers are iced, the teeth clutters 
The radio heard your anguish 
As did we

The bullet caresses your beating heart 
The gun falls, your vision blurs 
The border heard your last breath 
As did we
