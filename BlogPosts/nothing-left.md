Of course, you... who are you? 
No I don't have any coins. 
Get away from me 
You're dirtier than this train

I have no idea, who you are 
Are you even human? 
Can you marry? Start a family? 
Can you love?

Even as a child, even as I held you 
I knew, you could never be like me 
You are rare, precious, 
A pearl in the sea of salt.

I couldn't keep you, what would they think? 
They'll talk, you see? 
Talk about you. And me. 
I couldn't ignore their whispers.

I let them take you 
To keep you safe, away, safely away. 
To keep my future pure 
And yours... Afraid.

So when, on the train, 
I see you clap 
I see you beg 
I see you. 
I look away.
