I see him everyday 
Stressed out of his mind 
And everytime I just want to say 
To tell him 
It's okay. 
We're okay. 
We will be okay. 
You can relax.

But I don't. 
Because that's not how we talk to dads.

They're supposed to be an infallible wall 
The very definition of strength 
The courage to keep going 
Come what may 
So when he sighs at the end of a long day 
I want to hold him 
To tell him, how much I love him.

But I don't. 
Because that's not how we talk to dads.

No, I look at him. I smile. 
And he smiles too. 
And suddenly, everything is right in the world.
