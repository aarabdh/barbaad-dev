I have two masks 
Sometimes, they talk 
One laughs as one cries, 
And I just watch

One of them knows how to smile 
It can recognize the jokes 
And it knows not to frown 
And it has never cried 
Probably never will

The other doesn't know you 
I don't think it knows me, too 
It never seems to care about anything 
It keeps staring out of my eyes 
Looking at a gray world

They don't talk with words, 
Or anything else tangible, really 
They swirl into each other 
And skitter through my skin 
Often, I'm unsure which one is on my face 
And which one in my mind.
