Smoulders lit up the dusky sky 
Stones jumped to the rhythm 
Of the marching army, behold! 
Parley! Peace! River of blood.

Flames kissed the taste of copper 
And licked the barrels of gunpowder 
They danced through burning mothers 
And snuffed their burning sons.

Winds fought futile, the battle lost 
It retreated, hunted by the wildfire 
It spread like the sea, burned like the heart 
That sat on the pike, overlooking it all
