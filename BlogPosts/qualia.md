Green wind and the purple sunset 
Flying under the roots, take Odin's eye 
And rain deceit on the dreary sky 
Of dust and fog, cuffing your hand

Pink blood and grey rotten bones 
Sea of fumes, taste the sour tendons 
And throw misery on wooden falcons 
Of kings and kingdoms, ruling your land

Black stars and the violet moon 
Stashed beneath clouds, light the cages 
And let loose history on your pages 
Of tyranny and pain, of visions grand
