Everything we see is a fight 
A battle of wills, every night 
The lights flickering with the candles 
The darkness swaying in the shadows

Reflections are the refrees in this game 
Favouring none and all the same 
The streets are lined with luminations 
Hiding dreadfully silent Cimmerians

The moon watches in the heavens 
As the candle shines and weakens 
The shadow swells and swivels 
With every breeze that travels

The critters silently turn and vanish 
The predators keep hiding, famished 
And never does ever the fire 
Burn evermore brighter

The wax fails and the cat wails 
As the candle's lusture curtails 
The shadows creep ever closer 
As man hides in his enclosure

When the candle looses its last 
The shadows come hurrying fast 
And when dismay seems high 
Does the sun come lighting the sky

And so ends the game abstract 
Of the mouse, and of the cat
