Black 
You know the colour 
Black has them all, yet is the void 
It accepts everyone 
Everything

It doesn't shine 
Doesn't need to 
Others... They grab you 
They want to be looked at 
Black is forever content 
Fulfilled

Not many know of the true void 
Of the constant, unending, nothing 
The shadows cling to the void 
They know, light is but temporary 
The void is eternal

The void is your best friend 
It can take all your worries 
All the hate, anger, frustration 
It can take everything, and 
Expect nothing more

The void does not know you 
It can't 
Because light shines within you 
Speaking of glory, of pride 
And of change 
The void knows none.
