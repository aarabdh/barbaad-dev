Slumber in the branches 
Of a Grandfather Willow 
Close your colourful eyes 
And let your senses flow

The chimes of a piano 
A river falling over rocks 
Rising in an unending crescendo 
Chords of dripping drops

Wind squeezes through leaves 
Surges and dwindles anew 
A mystical Cuckoo sings 
Veiled by the morning dew

Drumming over the stems 
Bugs and ants unite 
Each in its own rhythms 
Orchestra of a sprite

The sun peeks and hides 
Hesitant and yet curious 
Clouds are the curtains 
Of this orchestra mysterious.
