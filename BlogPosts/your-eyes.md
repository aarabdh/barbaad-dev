Interweaving through the smithereens 
That once housed my heart 
I came across your eyes 
Hidden in the dark

Buried under the stone of regrets 
And the sand of longing despair 
My heart was lost 
But here you remained

Your innocent, young, black eyes 
Shining into our future 
I cried when I saw you 
Dead on the stretcher

Your face pale, your heart resting 
Sighing only at noon 
But then I saw your eyes 
Defiantly glaring into the void

They gave me a strength, a purpose 
An oath, to live against all odds 
A sense of duty, responsibility 
A shining sun through the clouds

So I persisted, I fought, and I lived 
And looked, looked at your eyes 
And when they looked at me 
And called me "Mama!"

I cried. And I smiled.
