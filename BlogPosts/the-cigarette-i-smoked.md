"Fire on command!" 
"Yes sir!" 
"On 1... 2... 3... FIRE!" 
BOOM 
my innocence died that day

"You new here?" 
"Yeah" 
"Gimme that plate, you greens know nothing of hunger." 
SNATCH 
my hunger died that day

"Keep walking!" 
"He's dead, sir!" 
"Then roll him away and take someone else!" 
THUMP 
my friendship died that day

"Kill him." 
"He's just a child, sir." 
"It'll be one less bullet in my head, then." 
BANG 
my hope died that day

"Have one." 
"Isn't it dangerous?" 
"Only as much as a bullet." 
SMOKE 
my lips died that day

"Your brother died." 
"No..." 
"Deal with it. I don't wanna carry two envelopes to your mother." 
CRY 
my heart died that day

"The war is over." 
"What can I do? Where do l go?" 
"Your home." 
"I will keep shooting the damned kettle whenever it whistles, sir." 
"What we all do, soldier, what we all do."
