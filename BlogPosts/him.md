A stone's throw away from your home 
Crossing a valley, toss of a mountain 
You'll find him. Wearing too large shoes 
On too little feet, walking on the mud 
His hands hold not his dreams and delights 
And nor does his feet carry the weight 
Of untold mysteries, of unspoken promises 
For he is not you.

No, his hands grope the rough pebbles and stones 
And the lies of too many politicians 
Pressing on his feet are dreams not his own 
But those of the adults, the preachers 
The liars, still 
And so he walks on the stumbling road 
Thinking his fall every other step 
And when they ask him to, 
He throws away his light and life 
In the shape of small, tiny pebbles. 
Later, they would be rocks, and bombs 
As they grow older 
Unlike him.
