Sometimes, I wonder.

What is death?

What an original idea, I know. Truly revolutionary.

But still, hear me out.

I think it's different for everyone.

Many studies have concluded that the human mind cannot comprehend its own death.

Think about it. Take a deep breath. And think.

Try to imagine yourself not existing.

Don't focus on your family, or friends. But focus on yourself. 

Think about not existing. Not breathing. Not looking. Not thinking.

Chances are, you can't.

And it's because, as I said, the human mind can't make sense of its own demise.

So, when the old woman lays on the hospital bed, and cries the silent tears filled with gratitude and regret in equal measure, as the life slips through her heart, what is she thinking, in those last few moments?

What is the last moment for her?

Now this might seem weird, but bear with me. What happens in dreams? How do you perceive time? Do you ever feel the passage of time in your dreams?

I think that last moment, that final thought inside her mind, that's her eternity.

Because, from her perspective, that's the last thought she had.

And because our mind can't comprehend its own non-existance, that is the only thought in her mind for the rest of her eternity.

We may bury her, or burn her and scatter her ashes, but she continues living in that one, eternal, moment.

Which plays like a long dream in that one second.

Think about it. A person who is truly happy, will have an eternal happiness. A person who's riddled with guilt, will forever be burdened by it.

And a person who is content, who is without any emotion, will actually *die*. And be free of the eternal emotion. In other words, Moksh.

This may seem very rambling sort of stuff, and maybe it is. Sharper minds than me have failed to answer the question of death.

But that won't stop me from trying.
