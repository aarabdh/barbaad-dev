Of course, you like girls 
Why wouldn't you? 
They're pretty, and you're a boy  
Don't hug him, he's a boy!

Forget about the swimming pool 
Where you saw Alex splashing 
He's got a girl, he's a smart boy 
So should you.

Forget the 10th grade teacher 
No, not Mrs. Garcia, silly! 
You're a boy, it's okay to like her 
Forget about Mr. Brown, though.

Forget the drunken night 
You didn't like kissing him, silly! 
It was probably the drinks, or the dare 
You shouldn't be drinking anyway.

Beards are great, of course 
You should have a beard too 
Beards make you a man 
That's why you like beards, of course.

You're a confused, growing boy 
You don't know what to think 
What to feel, whom to love 
Let me guide you, though.
