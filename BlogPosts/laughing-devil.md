The fiery clouds and the burning rain     
The Devil sat in despair, laughing again     
His laughter was like smoking oil     
On his hands did two snakes coil    

Venomous were their fangs, for kill     
Venomous more were their words, still     
Hissing and sizzling in the heat of hell     
They asked him, are you well?    

And he laughed harder, and said     
God is the giver of bread     
Why does he give them a rose     
Only to snatch it away, morose?    

Why give them food, give them mind     
When they will kill, and from behind?     
Why give them hunger for life      
Only to lay floods, plague and trife?     

I despair, because in all my years     
Never have I seen curiousity more fierce     
Than that of a man who wished to know     
Who built the world, whose seed they sow    

And I'm useless! Foolish, and naive!     
Humans want more than they can have     
And they will kill to have it all     
The blooming spring, the deafening fall     

God has made them more Devil than I      
And yet... and yet, they can cry!      
How? How! I don't understand.      
In which Eden do they stand?    

I laugh, my snakes, and despair     
For I can't make myself care     
Any being for which I,     
The devil,     
Would cry.
