The red moon had a blue king 
And he ruled over all red men 
The blue book called him a god 
And so they lived in their pen

The blue pen wrote often, 
Pages talked of the blue dynasty 
The red pen too wrote often, 
The wounds that were pretty nasty

The boy would bleed red, 
And return a red man. 
The blue king bleeds blue, 
Or so the legends began.

The red men bowed their heads 
Worked through rise and fall of red sun 
And the king sat on his blue throne 
And jumped, and rocked, so much fun!

And when the blue king died, 
Very few cried.

The red moon now had a yellow king 
And he ruled over the red 
And he bled yellow 
And they still bled red.
