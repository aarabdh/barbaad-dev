I never liked that tea, you know 
It was just an excuse 
To spend those evenings with you 
You, who will forever be ignorant 
Of my care for you.

I never liked the booze, you know 
It was just an excuse 
To see you free, and to be free 
Of expectations and traditions 
And to be with you.

I never liked that trek, you know 
It was just an excuse 
To see you alive, to feel the sun 
As it got lost in your ever tangled hair 
Like my thoughts of you.

I did like poetry, but you never did 
It is just my excuse 
To talk to you in a world 
Where we enjoyed this semester 
Me, with you.
