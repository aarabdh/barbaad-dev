The two played hide and seek 
Every day did Amy lose 
She hid under the bed, you see 
And he always found her

The game would start every day 
Sometimes by the pool 
Sometimes near the shower 
And he was always faster

She hated being found, 
And then hated losing again. 
Tears spilled on the ground 
And he was always stronger

Wiping her tears she would hide again 
And again 
And again

And then she saw the knife.

And she laughed

He couldn't find her if he couldn't see!
