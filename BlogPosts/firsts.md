You are the first, they said 
The first to fly to the moon. 
We will call you, they said 
Call you at dawn and noon.

You will be the first, they said 
The first to live on the moon. 
Alone, away, afraid, they meant 
You will miss your friends soon.

But you'll have to, they said 
To help us grow and reach. 
Silence will be your new friend 
And together you'll learn and teach.

I begged, I pleaded, I bled 
But they never even heard. 
I was but a little thread 
In the lovely nest of a bird.

Sorry, my child, mother said 
But you are very unique. 
Your fate, they had merrily read 
Will be bright, and yet bleak.

Your life will give life, they said 
To millions, nay billions of us. 
They never thought to check 
If there was a driver in the bus.
