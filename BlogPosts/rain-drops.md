As the rain drops race down the window 
Of my room, and I stare out into dusk 
I wonder, are we any different?

Are we all just endless tiny droplets? 
Released from the heavens, 
Doomed to fall through our life, 
With nary a whimper?

I see the drops flying and pattering 
Onto my thick glass window, 
As if they were people, 
Smacking at the invisible, deathly window.

But I look at the wind, the rainy gradient, 
And I smirk. 
Cause man never was so controlled 
Obeying orders as though a machine.

Man was to be unleashed, not herded 
To be blossomed, not bound. 
And never will man, 
Ever endure the chains of obedience.

Man will be free, decreed a man. 
And man will be free, so I declare 
As long as he fights the wind in his ears. 
And the sky will cherish the brilliant light 
Of a man, a sun, when he fights.
