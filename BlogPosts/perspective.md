Something eerie about a father 
Who stays home on a 
Monday morning 
Something right 
Something fascinating

Something hollow about a mother 
Who goes out with her friends 
And stays out for long 
Something wonderful 
Something liberating

Something disgusting about a sister 
Who makes intimate love 
To the love of her life 
Something happy 
Something endearing
