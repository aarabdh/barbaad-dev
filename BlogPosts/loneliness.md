It is easy to be alone, 
Just give yourself away.

I've been thinking about this, 
How can I be myself, 
If no one else is around?

When a lonely man sleeps 
Or when a lonely tree falls 
Do they make any sound?

I feel it is very easy, to be alone. 
If you stop feeling 
If you let go, and embrace the crowd.

Who am I? 
Just any other man, 
Neither here nor very loud.

Please ask me who I am. 
I will choose a mask 
And be myself with you.
