Smoke blowing off his parched mouth 
He clicked his tongue 
And then asked me, 
"Do you feel it?"

I simply stared at his impassive face 
And then I turned 
And looked at them, 
The bodies around me.

Blood oozed and clogged the beach 
Broken limbs scattered 
Faces blown away, 
"No," I replied.

His expression never changed any 
The glint in his eyes 
Shined with gritty reality 
He asked, "Why?"

"You killed them, not me," I said. "Not me." 
"True enough," he agreed. 
"But I am a mercenary. 
My job is to kill.

"You shook my hand with nary a whimper, 
You pointed them out 
And you never wavered. 
Am I really the killer?"

"No, I'm innocent," was my desperate plea 
And my eyes blurred 
As I pulled the trigger 
Of the gun in my hand.

My blood pooled around my heart 
The gun billowed smoke 
And it spun around 
And dropped from my hand.
