When the snow is black 
And the rocks are red 
Keep shooting, soldier 
We are with you.

When the food is rationed 
And the bunks are cramped 
Think of your home, trooper 
We are with you.

When the gear is too heavy 
And the guns are half empty 
Take our strength, warrior 
We are with you.

When your blood boils the snow 
And your steps shake the world 
Don't stray your aim, fighter 
We are with you.

When you hide behind the walls 
And your hands are frozen stone 
Don't lose hope, brother 
We are with you.

When a bullet caresses your heart 
And the night holds you in her arms 
Take rest, martyr 
We are with you.
