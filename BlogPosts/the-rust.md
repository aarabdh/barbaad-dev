The mournful tones just never seize 
With every 'morrow breeze 
It never knew the garden flowers 
Or the merry forest trees

The cage had rusted long ago 
The ropes eaten by age 
And yet it sat in the center 
Waiting for its cheese

Lament echoed in its squeeky voice 
Its nose followed the scent 
Of the flowers that bloomed, rejoice! 
Today the cage won't freeze

Its eyes were dilated, whisks unused 
As the darkness rumbled by 
Its feet and the cage floor, fused 
He had no need for activities!

The fly buzzed in the dusty sky  
Laughing in its freedom cursed 
The cage continued rusting by 
And it waited for the keys.
