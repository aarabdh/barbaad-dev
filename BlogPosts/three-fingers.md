Three fingers lived in a skinny house 
Neither were they fins nor claws 
Clutching their nerves worriedly 
They awaited a gripping tale

The beard sat in the scratched couch 
And spoke of a spine with a slouch 
That had never had the courage for defiance 
As the oppression grew as a nail

The little finger fiercely nodded 
For it couldn't, well, shake its head 
And said, "I would never do that! 
I'll never leave a trodden tail!"

The beard laughed in white and grey 
And said, "Little one, have no dismay. 
For the spine that fails to ever upright 
Can do narry but slowly fail."

The ring finger nodded righteously 
And looked at the middle, aggressively 
Who sighed, before he stood up 
And asked, "What will my discipline entail?"

"You will go back and apologise, 
To the thumb, whom you have bullied thrice, 
And only when he thumbs you up 
That you shall even get a bail."
