'Twas the day I died, 'twas the day you lived 
The unsinkable ship that sunk, the hopes and dreams 
The captain who wouldn't abandon ship 
The sorrowful choir that wouldn't cease 
'Twas the day I died, 'twas the day you lived.

From wealth, wrapped in a façade you came 
From heart, I came seeking shelter 
The fates were merciless, the night dark 
I could only save you, my heart 
'Twas the day I died, 'twas the day you lived.

We loved, we danced, we sang, we laughed 
We cried, we healed, we snuggled, we prayed 
The alarms wailed in tandem, the people scared 
We jumped into the sea, you and I, unafraid 
'Twas the day I died, 'twas the day you lived.

The wood couldn't hold us both, the sea was cold 
The ice was bitter, the ice was sweet 
I couldn't let it hurt you, my queen 
I floated beside you, alert, alive, but I couldn't hold 
'Twas the day I loved, Rose, 'twas the day you loved.
