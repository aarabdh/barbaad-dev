On an old rickety chair 
The old man sits again 
Again his tea breathes 
In the dead, dusty room

The clock seems to know 
His bed shudders with him 
His solitary companions 
In the dark, dreary room

A broken portrait of his son 
Sits over the elevated shelf 
The glass will cut you, they say 
In your frail, fragile skin

He watches his hands shake 
Tears spill, over flowing the cup 
Every tea tastes a bit salty 
In the desolate, deserted room

He sits there, watching 
The clock ticks ever slower 
A phone sits unringing 
In his deaf, defeated room
