Prometheus, o Prometheus 
What did you ever do right? 
Giving fire in the hand of man 
Setting its curiousity alight?

Prometheus, o Prometheus 
Giving man the Gods' Flame 
When it later destroyed Gaea 
Who is the one to blame?

Prometheus, o Prometheus 
True words only, did Zeus speak 
When he told you of the follies 
Of man, should he ever break

Prometheus, o Prometheus 
Much death lays in thy hand 
You allowed us to think freely 
You spilled the glass of sand

Prometheus, o Prometheus 
Whyever did you set us free? 
Dolls made for thy amusement 
Flawed we were, irreparably.

Prometheus, o Prometheus 
Whatever did you see in us? 
Why let us have the Forbidden 
Fruit, why torture us thus?

Prometheus, o Prometheus 
You were wrong about man 
You spoke of potential 
You spoke of greatness 
You spoke of curiousity 
But, we died before we ever began.
