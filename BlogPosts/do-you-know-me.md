I see you 
Sitting in your car 
Glaring at the traffic lights 
Loathing the red coloured light 
All I own is a red cotton saree 
Do you know me?

I see you 
Sitting in the train 
Waiting for your stop 
Glancing at your watch every minute 
I know the time by the blackness of my hand 
Do you know me?

I see you 
Sitting in your office 
Typing on your computer 
Shouting at your nervous inferiors 
I shout in the streets asking for trash 
Do you know me?

I see you 
Marching in your rallies 
Making clever posters 
Demanding to be heard 
I only ever demand to wake another day 
Do you know me?
