I sat on the couch,  
and drew with my crayons 
Mommy worked in the kitchen 
On all days, even Sunday! 
She worked day and night

Dad loved me, 
But he didn't liked her much, I think 
Or maybe he did 
Mommy said she hit me 
only because she loved me

I played with my granny, 
Dad kept reading the newspaper 
Mommy served the food 
And went back to cook again

Did we really eat that much?

Many times I saw her eyes sweaty 
I saw her hands red 
I saw her massaging her forehead 
And she told me 
it's all because of kitchen work

Kitchen must be a very dangerous place

One day I went to the kitchen 
I was really thirsty 
But mommy suddenly held me 
And her eyes were sweating again

I said to her, don't work so hard, mommy 
Tell me, I will help you 
And she held me even tighter 
She said, no.

No, you will not live in this hell 
You will draw, sing, dance, study 
You will live, my dear 
You will live for me.

And when her hands were all bloody 
And she wouldn't wake up 
I lived 
For her.
