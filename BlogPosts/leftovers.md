This is selfish of me, but 
I am a selfish man. 
Just this once, 
Allow me to be selfish.

What was once the striking of 
the clock at 5 in the evening 
Is now a condemnation 
Of every moment I enjoyed with you

Your shadows linger in the grass, 
On the benches, 
Along the roads, 
And, if you look closely, in my heart

I wish you well, and I hope you love deeply 
But this is my poem 
Please, allow me to be selfish 
Please, let me stop thinking about you.

So, how's the weather?
