Every bulb just as bright. 
Every shadow just as dark. 
Each and every one of them 
Fighting to be the brightest.

Every bulb has a shadow. 
Shadows exist for the light. 
They are so very different 
And yet they are alike

Everything was bright before 
Darkness is what shall remain 
But brightness without a source 
And darkness without an edge

Are they any different?
