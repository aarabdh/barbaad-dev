He never really had a choice, he decided 
Sitting on the decaying carpet 
Looking at a crumbled ceiling 
And looking at the stars through it

He had started a young lad, as all do 
As is done to them still, 
He had been dealt a hand 
A hand only meant for taking

His life was monotonous 
A single sentence written over and over 
On a muddy parchment 
Smeared through the years 

His job was to be unseen and nameless 
Nodding and yessing for the farce 
And whisking away the glasses. 
Motions, mundane and thoughtless

And if his calloused hands cleaned 
Another broken glass of wine 
He paid it no mind, 
And none was paid to him.
