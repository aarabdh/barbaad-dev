*4 dollar notes*

I bought some milk this evening 
The cashier give me 4 dollars and change 
My pockets soon found the notes crumpling 
And I walk, looking around in vain

The people that roamed at night 
Not the vehicles, but the walkers 
Shuffling around under the street light 
Moving as if they were under a curse

I watch silently, I am and out of this crowd 
Perhaps like the river is to the ocean 
A few kids are sitting by the road, head bowed 
I look at them. Then look away, without emotion.

The crafty hole in my pocket throws away a dollar 
For some reason, I never try to pick it up 
And I leave the corner and turn up my collar 
What? It's a chilly night, I want my chocolate cup.

The three dollars stare, as I fumble for the keys 
My Chevy has seen better days, and worse 
I pull the three notes and stare back, Jeez 
Stop guilting me with your treasure coarse

I sing and drive to the gas station 
And I see a robber running away 
My feet won't let me run, frozen 
But I do leave a dollar tip anyway

The two dollars are now like 2 rocks 
Much too heavy to carry around 
I blow them out of the window, and turn off the box 
Don't judge me, okay? I like the windy sound.

How could I? I don't know 
How did I? Easily 
Can you? Yes 
Should you?
