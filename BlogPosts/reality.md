Why have you called me in the middle of the night? 
Who troubles you, my dear? 
Is it the monsters hiding in the cupboard? 
Or the monsters that aren't? 
Is it people who you don't know? 
Or people that you do?

Come here, my dear. Rest on my lap. 
I will let you see the world in white and black 
Suffocate you with rules upon rules 
And then watch as you're hurt 
By people, white and black 
Because they are, after all, equal.

Sleep well, my dear. I will switch off the lights. 
And then I'll sit by your side 
And protect you from the monster under the bed 
While you run and hide in the day 
From the monsters that aren't afraid.
