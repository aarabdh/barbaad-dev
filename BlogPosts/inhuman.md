A voice box calls my name from 
Speakers unknown and bored 
The voice is human, the voice is a girl 
But it has no humanity 
As I board a plane.

Passengers are anxious, and deathly afraid 
But their masks hide those well 
As it hides them, and their face 
In a small metal box 
Thirty thousand feet above Wuhan.
