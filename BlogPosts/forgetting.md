If I had any children, I would tell them this 
"Even if I don't remember you, 
I love you."

Every day, I lose some pieces 
Pieces of my world, pieces of the puzzle 
They fall behind the dresser, 
They hide under the bed

And everyday, it gets harder to find them

Every day, a girl comes to my house 
She changes my clothes, cleans the dishes 
And she lets me cry on her shoulders 
She must be my daughter 
At least that's what I choose to believe

Every day I wake up lonelier, 
The sun is harsher on my eyes 
The world is sharp, I don't wear glasses 
It does make it harder for me though 
When I don't recognize anything

What is this life, what am I? 
Do memories not make a person? 
Am I not alive? Am I not real? 
Does everyone else exist? 
Why do I keep breathing?
