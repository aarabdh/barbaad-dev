Scuffed a bit on the edges here and there 
My sister dusted her skirt and folded it 
A large carton sat in her room 
In bold letters, it read, "Ready to wear!"

Ever so gently she pulled out a dress 
White as snow, almost new, worn thrice 
A tad too small, a smidge too little 
She hugged it, but folded it all the same

The carton became heavier still 
As tiny snowflakes condensed over her window 
"Five more minutes, honey!" mother called 
"Yes!" she shouted back, her tiny hands in a hurry

Father looked at her, then lifted the carton 
"Are you sure?" he asked again 
Her eyes found the little white dress 
Peaking through a hole in the carton

But she nodded with sincerety, 
So father nodded and loaded it in the car 
"I wanna come, too" she cried, suddenly 
"But..." Father sighed. "Fine," he said.

"You might not like what you see." 
"I'll be fine," her resolute only grew 
"Hop in," he said, and the car started 
Only then did I notice, her eyes were red

"Were you crying?" I asked. 
"No," she lied. "I'm so happy to do this." 
I too just nodded. The car sped downtown. 
"Put on your scarves, we're nearly there."

We did, and soon we were outside the orphanage 
Swings and rusted see-saws greeted us 
Winter filling the air with bitter frost 
Our boots stamped the fresh snow cover

We unloaded our cartons, but they were still unseen 
"Uhhm, hello?" My father tried 
A window to our right opened slightly 
A lady looked at us.

"We're here to donate!" My father said firmly 
Perhaps a bit too proudly 
Her face brightened, and soon the window was shut and the doors were open

The lady tucked at her thin jacket 
"Thank you, may lord give you blessings." 
Her voice was rough but kind, 
And my father responded with a nod

"We want to give it to them" he said 
The eyes of the lady flickered to my sister 
"I'm not sure..." she started. 
"It's okay," my father reassured her

She looked at him for a moment 
Nodding her head ever so slightly 
"Fine," was all she said 
We took the cartons and entered the orphanage

"Donations!" she called as soon as we were in 
A moment of silence, followed by a stampede of tiny feet 
And running they came, wearing tattered clothes 
And broken shoes, and smiling faces

The cartons were snatched, torn apart 
Clothes were being pulled and grabbed 
My eyes found the face of my sister 
And her eyes found dismay

She watched her treasured clothes 
Rupture and tear and stretched away 
She clutched my leg in fear 
"Why?" she shouted, "why did they..."

Her tears ran down my jeans.

The white dress was torn and stamped 
Dragged across the dirty muddy ground 
The children ran back, up the soaked wooden stairs 
And there was silence

The lady looked on, sadly 
Father picked up my sister 
We found ourselves back in the car 
My sister curled up, bawling in my lap

"That is all they know, honey." 
Father tried consoling her 
"All their life they have snatched, 
Stolen, robbed, everything."

Her sobs eventually stopped 
"I understand," she said sadly 
"I hope so, and if not today..." 
Father paused.

"And if not today, I hope tomorrow."
