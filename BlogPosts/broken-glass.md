I live in a brothel 
The reds and the low lights hide my shards 
The blood that is spilt every night 
If not in this room then the next

I come from the glass bangles 
And sometimes from expensive wine bottles 
Occasionally, from the broken mirror too 
It really is easy to find me there

Hearing screams is quite common 
Pleasure filled ones, not quite 
Not one day passes by 
Where I'm not held to the neck of a woman

I wasn't red, originally 
But this place... There is so much red around 
I have forgotten the other colours 
And they have forgotten me

My shine has dried up, as have my eyes 
But somedays, somedays... 
I cry the red tears of those girls 
As they bleed on my bed.
