Whisper whisper whisper 
flutter flutter 
On went the light 
Off went the light 
Callous cretins chirruped 
Curtains curtsied curtly 
The twenty first century

Fiends found follies 
follies found fractures 
Great giants gorged 
glinting glamorous gems 
Slimy slithery sunken 
streets swelling slowly 
The twenty first century

Rotten rugged rough rubble 
Refugees ravaging roadside roughage 
Rape rage rose 
Roaring righteous resolutions 
Ruthless rigidity 
The twenty first century

Slender seductresses serving 
Sluggish sinister strangers 
Sulphurous smoke swallowing 
Soldiers, servicemen, saints 
Soaring slavery 
The twenty first century

Questioning queers 
Quires quoting Queens' quests 
Quality quizzing quorums 
Quite quiet, quick queues 
Quippy quills quelling quandaries 
The twenty first century.
