It is easy to be alone, <br><br/>
Just give yourself away.

I've been thinking about this, <br><br/>
How can I be myself, <br><br/>
If no one else is around?

When a lonely man sleeps <br><br/>
Or when a lonely tree falls <br><br/>
Do they make any sound?

I feel it is very easy, to be alone. <br><br/>
If you stop feeling <br><br/>
If you let go, and embrace the crowd.

Who am I? <br><br/>
Just any other man, <br><br/>
Neither here nor very loud.

Please ask me who I am. <br><br/>
I will choose a mask <br><br/>
And be myself with you.
