I never liked that tea, you know <br><br/>
It was just an excuse <br><br/>
To spend those evenings with you <br><br/>
You, who will forever be ignorant <br><br/>
Of my care for you.

I never liked the booze, you know <br><br/>
It was just an excuse <br><br/>
To see you free, and to be free <br><br/>
Of expectations and traditions <br><br/>
And to be with you.

I never liked that trek, you know <br><br/>
It was just an excuse <br><br/>
To see you alive, to feel the sun <br><br/>
As it got lost in your ever tangled hair <br><br/>
Like my thoughts of you.

I did like poetry, but you never did <br><br/>
It is just my excuse <br><br/>
To talk to you in a world <br><br/>
Where we enjoyed this semester <br><br/>
Me, with you.
