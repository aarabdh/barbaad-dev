Every bulb just as bright. <br><br/>
Every shadow just as dark. <br><br/>
Each and every one of them <br><br/>
Fighting to be the brightest.

Every bulb has a shadow. <br><br/>
Shadows exist for the light. <br><br/>
They are so very different <br><br/>
And yet they are alike

Everything was bright before <br><br/>
Darkness is what shall remain <br><br/>
But brightness without a source <br><br/>
And darkness without an edge

Are they any different?
