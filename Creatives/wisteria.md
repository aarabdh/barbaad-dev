"Hey! Don't walk so fast!" Daphne exclaimed.

"Oh, sorry." Harry backtracked his way and held her hand. "I'm just... excited."

"I know," she smiled. "So when will you give me this surprise you have planned?"

"Uh... Just wait for another minute. We'll be there soon."

Cut to rose scene.

Harry carefully plucked a rose, then broke away the thorns and handed it to Daphne.

"What's this?" Daphne asked.

"That's a rose," Harry said. "It is known to be the most beautiful flower in the world. It has the most vibrant red petals, soft and yet firm, wrapped in an intricate spiral of twirls. Lovers all over the world gift roses to each other to show their love."

She touched the petals, counting them, trying to make an image in her mind.

She sighed in sadness when all she felt was bundled up leaves in an intricate pattern she couldn't see. So many sensations just out of her reach...

Seeing her singh, Harry smiled, then pulled out a bunch of purple flowers from a tree.

"This however... Is called Wisteria." He handed her the stem.

"It doesn't look very impressive," he continued, peeking her interest, "in fact, you could find this growing out in the wild."

He paused. Daphne knew he was baiting her, but she couldn't resist.

"Why is it unique?" she asked as she ran her hand over the bunch.

Harry held her hand, and brought the flowers closer to her face. She could feel his breath on her neck.

"It smells heavenly."

She inhaled, trying to smell their fragrance. Daphne agreed with Harry, it really did smell heavenly.

"Sometimes," he continued, "all you need is closeness."

And just like that, Harry was walking ahead, leading her by her hand.

She felt the two stems in her hand, and threw away the rose, as she hurried behind him.
