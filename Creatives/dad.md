I see him everyday <br><br/>
Stressed out of his mind <br><br/>
And everytime I just want to say <br><br/>
To tell him <br><br/>
It's okay. <br><br/>
We're okay. <br><br/>
We will be okay. <br><br/>
You can relax.

But I don't. <br><br/>
Because that's not how we talk to dads.

They're supposed to be an infallible wall <br><br/>
The very definition of strength <br><br/>
The courage to keep going <br><br/>
Come what may <br><br/>
So when he sighs at the end of a long day <br><br/>
I want to hold him <br><br/>
To tell him, how much I love him.

But I don't. <br><br/>
Because that's not how we talk to dads.

No, I look at him. I smile. <br><br/>
And he smiles too. <br><br/>
And suddenly, everything is right in the world.
