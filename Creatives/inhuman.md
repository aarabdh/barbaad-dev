A voice box calls my name from <br><br/>
Speakers unknown and bored <br><br/>
The voice is human, the voice is a girl <br><br/>
But it has no humanity <br><br/>
As I board a plane.

Passengers are anxious, and deathly afraid <br><br/>
But their masks hide those well <br><br/>
As it hides them, and their face <br><br/>
In a small metal box <br><br/>
Thirty thousand feet above Wuhan.
