The fiery clouds and the burning rain     <br><br/>
The Devil sat in despair, laughing again     <br><br/>
His laughter was like smoking oil     <br><br/>
On his hands did two snakes coil    

Venomous were their fangs, for kill     <br><br/>
Venomous more were their words, still     <br><br/>
Hissing and sizzling in the heat of hell     <br><br/>
They asked him, are you well?    

And he laughed harder, and said     <br><br/>
God is the giver of bread     <br><br/>
Why does he give them a rose     <br><br/>
Only to snatch it away, morose?    

Why give them food, give them mind     <br><br/>
When they will kill, and from behind?     <br><br/>
Why give them hunger for life      <br><br/>
Only to lay floods, plague and trife?     

I despair, because in all my years     <br><br/>
Never have I seen curiousity more fierce     <br><br/>
Than that of a man who wished to know     <br><br/>
Who built the world, whose seed they sow    

And I'm useless! Foolish, and naive!     <br><br/>
Humans want more than they can have     <br><br/>
And they will kill to have it all     <br><br/>
The blooming spring, the deafening fall     

God has made them more Devil than I      <br><br/>
And yet... and yet, they can cry!      <br><br/>
How? How! I don't understand.      <br><br/>
In which Eden do they stand?    

I laugh, my snakes, and despair     <br><br/>
For I can't make myself care     <br><br/>
Any being for which I,     <br><br/>
The devil,     <br><br/>
Would cry.
