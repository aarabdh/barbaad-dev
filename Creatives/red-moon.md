The red moon had a blue king <br><br/>
And he ruled over all red men <br><br/>
The blue book called him a god <br><br/>
And so they lived in their pen

The blue pen wrote often, <br><br/>
Pages talked of the blue dynasty <br><br/>
The red pen too wrote often, <br><br/>
The wounds that were pretty nasty

The boy would bleed red, <br><br/>
And return a red man. <br><br/>
The blue king bleeds blue, <br><br/>
Or so the legends began.

The red men bowed their heads <br><br/>
Worked through rise and fall of red sun <br><br/>
And the king sat on his blue throne <br><br/>
And jumped, and rocked, so much fun!

And when the blue king died, <br><br/>
Very few cried.

The red moon now had a yellow king <br><br/>
And he ruled over the red <br><br/>
And he bled yellow <br><br/>
And they still bled red.
