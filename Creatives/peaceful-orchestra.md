Slumber in the branches <br><br/>
Of a Grandfather Willow <br><br/>
Close your colourful eyes <br><br/>
And let your senses flow

The chimes of a piano <br><br/>
A river falling over rocks <br><br/>
Rising in an unending crescendo <br><br/>
Chords of dripping drops

Wind squeezes through leaves <br><br/>
Surges and dwindles anew <br><br/>
A mystical Cuckoo sings <br><br/>
Veiled by the morning dew

Drumming over the stems <br><br/>
Bugs and ants unite <br><br/>
Each in its own rhythms <br><br/>
Orchestra of a sprite

The sun peeks and hides <br><br/>
Hesitant and yet curious <br><br/>
Clouds are the curtains <br><br/>
Of this orchestra mysterious.
