Prometheus, o Prometheus <br><br/>
What did you ever do right? <br><br/>
Giving fire in the hand of man <br><br/>
Setting its curiousity alight?

Prometheus, o Prometheus <br><br/>
Giving man the Gods' Flame <br><br/>
When it later destroyed Gaea <br><br/>
Who is the one to blame?

Prometheus, o Prometheus <br><br/>
True words only, did Zeus speak <br><br/>
When he told you of the follies <br><br/>
Of man, should he ever break

Prometheus, o Prometheus <br><br/>
Much death lays in thy hand <br><br/>
You allowed us to think freely <br><br/>
You spilled the glass of sand

Prometheus, o Prometheus <br><br/>
Whyever did you set us free? <br><br/>
Dolls made for thy amusement <br><br/>
Flawed we were, irreparably.

Prometheus, o Prometheus <br><br/>
Whatever did you see in us? <br><br/>
Why let us have the Forbidden <br><br/>
Fruit, why torture us thus?

Prometheus, o Prometheus <br><br/>
You were wrong about man <br><br/>
You spoke of potential <br><br/>
You spoke of greatness <br><br/>
You spoke of curiousity <br><br/>
But, we died before we ever began.
