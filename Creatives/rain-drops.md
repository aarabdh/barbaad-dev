As the rain drops race down the window <br><br/>
Of my room, and I stare out into dusk <br><br/>
I wonder, are we any different?

Are we all just endless tiny droplets? <br><br/>
Released from the heavens, <br><br/>
Doomed to fall through our life, <br><br/>
With nary a whimper?

I see the drops flying and pattering <br><br/>
Onto my thick glass window, <br><br/>
As if they were people, <br><br/>
Smacking at the invisible, deathly window.

But I look at the wind, the rainy gradient, <br><br/>
And I smirk. <br><br/>
Cause man never was so controlled <br><br/>
Obeying orders as though a machine.

Man was to be unleashed, not herded <br><br/>
To be blossomed, not bound. <br><br/>
And never will man, <br><br/>
Ever endure the chains of obedience.

Man will be free, decreed a man. <br><br/>
And man will be free, so I declare <br><br/>
As long as he fights the wind in his ears. <br><br/>
And the sky will cherish the brilliant light <br><br/>
Of a man, a sun, when he fights.
