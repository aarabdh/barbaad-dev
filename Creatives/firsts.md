You are the first, they said <br><br/>
The first to fly to the moon. <br><br/>
We will call you, they said <br><br/>
Call you at dawn and noon.

You will be the first, they said <br><br/>
The first to live on the moon. <br><br/>
Alone, away, afraid, they meant <br><br/>
You will miss your friends soon.

But you'll have to, they said <br><br/>
To help us grow and reach. <br><br/>
Silence will be your new friend <br><br/>
And together you'll learn and teach.

I begged, I pleaded, I bled <br><br/>
But they never even heard. <br><br/>
I was but a little thread <br><br/>
In the lovely nest of a bird.

Sorry, my child, mother said <br><br/>
But you are very unique. <br><br/>
Your fate, they had merrily read <br><br/>
Will be bright, and yet bleak.

Your life will give life, they said <br><br/>
To millions, nay billions of us. <br><br/>
They never thought to check <br><br/>
If there was a driver in the bus.
