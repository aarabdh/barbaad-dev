Why have you called me in the middle of the night? <br><br/>
Who troubles you, my dear? <br><br/>
Is it the monsters hiding in the cupboard? <br><br/>
Or the monsters that aren't? <br><br/>
Is it people who you don't know? <br><br/>
Or people that you do?

Come here, my dear. Rest on my lap. <br><br/>
I will let you see the world in white and black <br><br/>
Suffocate you with rules upon rules <br><br/>
And then watch as you're hurt <br><br/>
By people, white and black <br><br/>
Because they are, after all, equal.

Sleep well, my dear. I will switch off the lights. <br><br/>
And then I'll sit by your side <br><br/>
And protect you from the monster under the bed <br><br/>
While you run and hide in the day <br><br/>
From the monsters that aren't afraid.
