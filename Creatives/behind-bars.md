I've looked at him for years now <br/>
Sitting with naught but a mornful look <br/>
He explores his tiny grey cell <br/>
With only his eyes

"What do you think about?" <br/>
I ask him one day, curious <br/>
He looks at me, then looks away <br/>
I continue my inspection down the row

"Charged for sexual assault on minor" <br/>
I read his file in my curiosity <br/>
Disgust fills me, the next time I see him, <br/>
I spit on his food as he looks

He eats it just the same

"Her" I hear him say <br/>
As I walk down outside his cell <br/>
"What?" I ask, having no patience <br/>
For a rapist like him

"I think about her" I hear him say <br/>
"I hope she has forgotten me <br/>
I shouldn't have existed." <br/>
"Too late for that," I bite out

"Yes it is." He turns around. <br/>
I see the cuts on the back of his arms <br/>
I nod righteously, I keep walking. <br/>
He looks back at the grey wall

I sit in my office, sipping the tasteless tea <br/>
The courtyard alarms blare suddenly <br/>
I am out of the doors in an instant <br/>
And a pistol rests in my hand

"What the-" I stop. The rapist is bleeding <br/>
The other prisoner is held back by the guards <br/>
"When are they hanging you?" He shouts <br/>
"Take him away," I sigh

"He deserves it!" The assailant shouts at me <br/>
"Are you above the law?" I sneer at him <br/>
He has the good sense to back down <br/>
I hesitate before calling for the medics

The rapist gets up, <br/>
He picks up the shovel <br/>
And he begins digging <br/>
Blood running down his face

"Why?" my question startles him <br/>
"I don't remember." <br/>
"Why do you continue living?" <br/>
For the first time ever, he looks me in the eyes

"I'm not a coward," he says. <br/>
"I'm sure that's what she thought too" <br/>
He immediately looks away <br/>
I leave him to the first aid

"You are not evil," I say as I slide him the food <br/>
He doesn't respond <br/>
"Today is my last day here. <br/>
I hope for your repentance."

"Rape convict commits suicide" <br/>
Reads the newspaper headline the next day <br/>
I sip the tasteless tea at my home <br/>
It tastes very salty today.
