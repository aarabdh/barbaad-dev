The mournful tones just never seize <br><br/>
With every 'morrow breeze <br><br/>
It never knew the garden flowers <br><br/>
Or the merry forest trees

The cage had rusted long ago <br><br/>
The ropes eaten by age <br><br/>
And yet it sat in the center <br><br/>
Waiting for its cheese

Lament echoed in its squeeky voice <br><br/>
Its nose followed the scent <br><br/>
Of the flowers that bloomed, rejoice! <br><br/>
Today the cage won't freeze

Its eyes were dilated, whisks unused <br><br/>
As the darkness rumbled by <br><br/>
Its feet and the cage floor, fused <br><br/>
He had no need for activities!

The fly buzzed in the dusty sky  <br><br/>
Laughing in its freedom cursed <br><br/>
The cage continued rusting by <br><br/>
And it waited for the keys.
