Black <br><br/>
You know the colour <br><br/>
Black has them all, yet is the void <br><br/>
It accepts everyone <br><br/>
Everything

It doesn't shine <br><br/>
Doesn't need to <br><br/>
Others... They grab you <br><br/>
They want to be looked at <br><br/>
Black is forever content <br><br/>
Fulfilled

Not many know of the true void <br><br/>
Of the constant, unending, nothing <br><br/>
The shadows cling to the void <br><br/>
They know, light is but temporary <br><br/>
The void is eternal

The void is your best friend <br><br/>
It can take all your worries <br><br/>
All the hate, anger, frustration <br><br/>
It can take everything, and <br><br/>
Expect nothing more

The void does not know you <br><br/>
It can't <br><br/>
Because light shines within you <br><br/>
Speaking of glory, of pride <br><br/>
And of change <br><br/>
The void knows none.
