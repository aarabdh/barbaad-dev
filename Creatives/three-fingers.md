Three fingers lived in a skinny house <br><br/>
Neither were they fins nor claws <br><br/>
Clutching their nerves worriedly <br><br/>
They awaited a gripping tale

The beard sat in the scratched couch <br><br/>
And spoke of a spine with a slouch <br><br/>
That had never had the courage for defiance <br><br/>
As the oppression grew as a nail

The little finger fiercely nodded <br><br/>
For it couldn't, well, shake its head <br><br/>
And said, "I would never do that! <br><br/>
I'll never leave a trodden tail!"

The beard laughed in white and grey <br><br/>
And said, "Little one, have no dismay. <br><br/>
For the spine that fails to ever upright <br><br/>
Can do narry but slowly fail."

The ring finger nodded righteously <br><br/>
And looked at the middle, aggressively <br><br/>
Who sighed, before he stood up <br><br/>
And asked, "What will my discipline entail?"

"You will go back and apologise, <br><br/>
To the thumb, whom you have bullied thrice, <br><br/>
And only when he thumbs you up <br><br/>
That you shall even get a bail."
