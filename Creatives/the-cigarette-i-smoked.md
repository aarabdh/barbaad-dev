"Fire on command!" <br><br/>
"Yes sir!" <br><br/>
"On 1... 2... 3... FIRE!" <br><br/>
BOOM <br><br/>
my innocence died that day

"You new here?" <br><br/>
"Yeah" <br><br/>
"Gimme that plate, you greens know nothing of hunger." <br><br/>
SNATCH <br><br/>
my hunger died that day

"Keep walking!" <br><br/>
"He's dead, sir!" <br><br/>
"Then roll him away and take someone else!" <br><br/>
THUMP <br><br/>
my friendship died that day

"Kill him." <br><br/>
"He's just a child, sir." <br><br/>
"It'll be one less bullet in my head, then." <br><br/>
BANG <br><br/>
my hope died that day

"Have one." <br><br/>
"Isn't it dangerous?" <br><br/>
"Only as much as a bullet." <br><br/>
SMOKE <br><br/>
my lips died that day

"Your brother died." <br><br/>
"No..." <br><br/>
"Deal with it. I don't wanna carry two envelopes to your mother." <br><br/>
CRY <br><br/>
my heart died that day

"The war is over." <br><br/>
"What can I do? Where do l go?" <br><br/>
"Your home." <br><br/>
"I will keep shooting the damned kettle whenever it whistles, sir." <br><br/>
"What we all do, soldier, what we all do."
