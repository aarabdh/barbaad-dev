I sat on the couch,  <br><br/>
and drew with my crayons <br><br/>
Mommy worked in the kitchen <br><br/>
On all days, even Sunday! <br><br/>
She worked day and night

Dad loved me, <br><br/>
But he didn't liked her much, I think <br><br/>
Or maybe he did <br><br/>
Mommy said she hit me <br><br/>
only because she loved me

I played with my granny, <br><br/>
Dad kept reading the newspaper <br><br/>
Mommy served the food <br><br/>
And went back to cook again

Did we really eat that much?

Many times I saw her eyes sweaty <br><br/>
I saw her hands red <br><br/>
I saw her massaging her forehead <br><br/>
And she told me <br><br/>
it's all because of kitchen work

Kitchen must be a very dangerous place

One day I went to the kitchen <br><br/>
I was really thirsty <br><br/>
But mommy suddenly held me <br><br/>
And her eyes were sweating again

I said to her, don't work so hard, mommy <br><br/>
Tell me, I will help you <br><br/>
And she held me even tighter <br><br/>
She said, no.

No, you will not live in this hell <br><br/>
You will draw, sing, dance, study <br><br/>
You will live, my dear <br><br/>
You will live for me.

And when her hands were all bloody <br><br/>
And she wouldn't wake up <br><br/>
I lived <br><br/>
For her.
