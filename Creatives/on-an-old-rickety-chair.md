On an old rickety chair <br><br/>
The old man sits again <br><br/>
Again his tea breathes <br><br/>
In the dead, dusty room

The clock seems to know <br><br/>
His bed shudders with him <br><br/>
His solitary companions <br><br/>
In the dark, dreary room

A broken portrait of his son <br><br/>
Sits over the elevated shelf <br><br/>
The glass will cut you, they say <br><br/>
In your frail, fragile skin

He watches his hands shake <br><br/>
Tears spill, over flowing the cup <br><br/>
Every tea tastes a bit salty <br><br/>
In the desolate, deserted room

He sits there, watching <br><br/>
The clock ticks ever slower <br><br/>
A phone sits unringing <br><br/>
In his deaf, defeated room
