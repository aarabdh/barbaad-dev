Of course, you like girls <br><br/>
Why wouldn't you? <br><br/>
They're pretty, and you're a boy  <br><br/>
Don't hug him, he's a boy!

Forget about the swimming pool <br><br/>
Where you saw Alex splashing <br><br/>
He's got a girl, he's a smart boy <br><br/>
So should you.

Forget the 10th grade teacher <br><br/>
No, not Mrs. Garcia, silly! <br><br/>
You're a boy, it's okay to like her <br><br/>
Forget about Mr. Brown, though.

Forget the drunken night <br><br/>
You didn't like kissing him, silly! <br><br/>
It was probably the drinks, or the dare <br><br/>
You shouldn't be drinking anyway.

Beards are great, of course <br><br/>
You should have a beard too <br><br/>
Beards make you a man <br><br/>
That's why you like beards, of course.

You're a confused, growing boy <br><br/>
You don't know what to think <br><br/>
What to feel, whom to love <br><br/>
Let me guide you, though.
