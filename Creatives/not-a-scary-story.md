The two played hide and seek <br><br/>
Every day did Amy lose <br><br/>
She hid under the bed, you see <br><br/>
And he always found her

The game would start every day <br><br/>
Sometimes by the pool <br><br/>
Sometimes near the shower <br><br/>
And he was always faster

She hated being found, <br><br/>
And then hated losing again. <br><br/>
Tears spilled on the ground <br><br/>
And he was always stronger

Wiping her tears she would hide again <br><br/>
And again <br><br/>
And again

And then she saw the knife.

And she laughed

He couldn't find her if he couldn't see!
