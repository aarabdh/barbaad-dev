When the snow is black <br><br/>
And the rocks are red <br><br/>
Keep shooting, soldier <br><br/>
We are with you.

When the food is rationed <br><br/>
And the bunks are cramped <br><br/>
Think of your home, trooper <br><br/>
We are with you.

When the gear is too heavy <br><br/>
And the guns are half empty <br><br/>
Take our strength, warrior <br><br/>
We are with you.

When your blood boils the snow <br><br/>
And your steps shake the world <br><br/>
Don't stray your aim, fighter <br><br/>
We are with you.

When you hide behind the walls <br><br/>
And your hands are frozen stone <br><br/>
Don't lose hope, brother <br><br/>
We are with you.

When a bullet caresses your heart <br><br/>
And the night holds you in her arms <br><br/>
Take rest, martyr <br><br/>
We are with you.
