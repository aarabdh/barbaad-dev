The snow was black, the rocks were red <br><br/>
The gear was heavy, the gun half empty <br><br/>
The rolling valleys saw your strength <br><br/>
As did we

The winds carry the smell of home <br><br/>
The flavour of chilly, the softness of roti <br><br/>
Your empty plate felt your sorrow <br><br/>
As did we

The bulky bunks feel too cramped <br><br/>
Your bed is cold, your toes colder <br><br/>
The open windows heard your shivers <br><br/>
As did we

The days have turned into warmer nights <br><br/>
Your breath freezes, your heart shouts <br><br/>
Your friend held your hand <br><br/>
As did we

The blood boils against the tyranny of cold <br><br/>
The fingers are iced, the teeth clutters <br><br/>
The radio heard your anguish <br><br/>
As did we

The bullet caresses your beating heart <br><br/>
The gun falls, your vision blurs <br><br/>
The border heard your last breath <br><br/>
As did we
