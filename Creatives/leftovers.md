This is selfish of me, but <br><br/>
I am a selfish man. <br><br/>
Just this once, <br><br/>
Allow me to be selfish.

What was once the striking of <br><br/>
the clock at 5 in the evening <br><br/>
Is now a condemnation <br><br/>
Of every moment I enjoyed with you

Your shadows linger in the grass, <br><br/>
On the benches, <br><br/>
Along the roads, <br><br/>
And, if you look closely, in my heart

I wish you well, and I hope you love deeply <br><br/>
But this is my poem <br><br/>
Please, allow me to be selfish <br><br/>
Please, let me stop thinking about you.

So, how's the weather?
