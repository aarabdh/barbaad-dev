Something eerie about a father <br><br/>
Who stays home on a <br><br/>
Monday morning <br><br/>
Something right <br><br/>
Something fascinating

Something hollow about a mother <br><br/>
Who goes out with her friends <br><br/>
And stays out for long <br><br/>
Something wonderful <br><br/>
Something liberating

Something disgusting about a sister <br><br/>
Who makes intimate love <br><br/>
To the love of her life <br><br/>
Something happy <br><br/>
Something endearing
