I have waited for this day <br><br/>
The day after yesterday <br><br/>
The day before tomorrow.

Everything is perfect. <br><br/>
We are sitting on the park bench <br><br/>
I help you up on the feet <br><br/>
Your curls would sway in the wind <br><br/>
If you still had them.

It is a quiet day of winter.

I drop to a knee, and you gasp <br><br/>
I cannot, will not look up <br><br/>
I fumble with the ring <br><br/>
But then I say, <br><br/>
"Will you marry me?"

"But—" <br><br/>
"I know." <br><br/>
"What abo—" <br><br/>
"We'll make do." <br><br/>
"Are you sure?" you ask

Am I? <br><br/>
I grip your frail hands <br><br/>
I have never been more sure <br><br/>
I slip the ring on your finger.

And it slips back out. <br><br/>
Our guffaw is unanimous <br><br/>
The ring had been ordered an year ago <br><br/>
You were... more, back then.

Even still, I grope around in the grass <br><br/>
The ring will not slip this time <br><br/>
Our intertwined hands won't allow it.

We watch the sun peak through the trees <br><br/>
Watch the world wake up <br><br/>
If only this winter could last forever.
