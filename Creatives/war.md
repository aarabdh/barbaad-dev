Smoulders lit up the dusky sky <br><br/>
Stones jumped to the rhythm <br><br/>
Of the marching army, behold! <br><br/>
Parley! Peace! River of blood.

Flames kissed the taste of copper <br><br/>
And licked the barrels of gunpowder <br><br/>
They danced through burning mothers <br><br/>
And snuffed their burning sons.

Winds fought futile, the battle lost <br><br/>
It retreated, hunted by the wildfire <br><br/>
It spread like the sea, burned like the heart <br><br/>
That sat on the pike, overlooking it all
