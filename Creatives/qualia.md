Green wind and the purple sunset <br><br/>
Flying under the roots, take Odin's eye <br><br/>
And rain deceit on the dreary sky <br><br/>
Of dust and fog, cuffing your hand

Pink blood and grey rotten bones <br><br/>
Sea of fumes, taste the sour tendons <br><br/>
And throw misery on wooden falcons <br><br/>
Of kings and kingdoms, ruling your land

Black stars and the violet moon <br><br/>
Stashed beneath clouds, light the cages <br><br/>
And let loose history on your pages <br><br/>
Of tyranny and pain, of visions grand
