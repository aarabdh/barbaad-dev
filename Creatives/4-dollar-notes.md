*4 dollar notes*

I bought some milk this evening <br><br/>
The cashier give me 4 dollars and change <br><br/>
My pockets soon found the notes crumpling <br><br/>
And I walk, looking around in vain

The people that roamed at night <br><br/>
Not the vehicles, but the walkers <br><br/>
Shuffling around under the street light <br><br/>
Moving as if they were under a curse

I watch silently, I am and out of this crowd <br><br/>
Perhaps like the river is to the ocean <br><br/>
A few kids are sitting by the road, head bowed <br><br/>
I look at them. Then look away, without emotion.

The crafty hole in my pocket throws away a dollar <br><br/>
For some reason, I never try to pick it up <br><br/>
And I leave the corner and turn up my collar <br><br/>
What? It's a chilly night, I want my chocolate cup.

The three dollars stare, as I fumble for the keys <br><br/>
My Chevy has seen better days, and worse <br><br/>
I pull the three notes and stare back, Jeez <br><br/>
Stop guilting me with your treasure coarse

I sing and drive to the gas station <br><br/>
And I see a robber running away <br><br/>
My feet won't let me run, frozen <br><br/>
But I do leave a dollar tip anyway

The two dollars are now like 2 rocks <br><br/>
Much too heavy to carry around <br><br/>
I blow them out of the window, and turn off the box <br><br/>
Don't judge me, okay? I like the windy sound.

How could I? I don't know <br><br/>
How did I? Easily <br><br/>
Can you? Yes <br><br/>
Should you?
