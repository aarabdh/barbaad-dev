Scuffed a bit on the edges here and there <br><br/>
My sister dusted her skirt and folded it <br><br/>
A large carton sat in her room <br><br/>
In bold letters, it read, "Ready to wear!"

Ever so gently she pulled out a dress <br><br/>
White as snow, almost new, worn thrice <br><br/>
A tad too small, a smidge too little <br><br/>
She hugged it, but folded it all the same

The carton became heavier still <br><br/>
As tiny snowflakes condensed over her window <br><br/>
"Five more minutes, honey!" mother called <br><br/>
"Yes!" she shouted back, her tiny hands in a hurry

Father looked at her, then lifted the carton <br><br/>
"Are you sure?" he asked again <br><br/>
Her eyes found the little white dress <br><br/>
Peaking through a hole in the carton

But she nodded with sincerety, <br><br/>
So father nodded and loaded it in the car <br><br/>
"I wanna come, too" she cried, suddenly <br><br/>
"But..." Father sighed. "Fine," he said.

"You might not like what you see." <br><br/>
"I'll be fine," her resolute only grew <br><br/>
"Hop in," he said, and the car started <br><br/>
Only then did I notice, her eyes were red

"Were you crying?" I asked. <br><br/>
"No," she lied. "I'm so happy to do this." <br><br/>
I too just nodded. The car sped downtown. <br><br/>
"Put on your scarves, we're nearly there."

We did, and soon we were outside the orphanage <br><br/>
Swings and rusted see-saws greeted us <br><br/>
Winter filling the air with bitter frost <br><br/>
Our boots stamped the fresh snow cover

We unloaded our cartons, but they were still unseen <br><br/>
"Uhhm, hello?" My father tried <br><br/>
A window to our right opened slightly <br><br/>
A lady looked at us.

"We're here to donate!" My father said firmly <br><br/>
Perhaps a bit too proudly <br><br/>
Her face brightened, and soon the window was shut and the doors were open

The lady tucked at her thin jacket <br><br/>
"Thank you, may lord give you blessings." <br><br/>
Her voice was rough but kind, <br><br/>
And my father responded with a nod

"We want to give it to them" he said <br><br/>
The eyes of the lady flickered to my sister <br><br/>
"I'm not sure..." she started. <br><br/>
"It's okay," my father reassured her

She looked at him for a moment <br><br/>
Nodding her head ever so slightly <br><br/>
"Fine," was all she said <br><br/>
We took the cartons and entered the orphanage

"Donations!" she called as soon as we were in <br><br/>
A moment of silence, followed by a stampede of tiny feet <br><br/>
And running they came, wearing tattered clothes <br><br/>
And broken shoes, and smiling faces

The cartons were snatched, torn apart <br><br/>
Clothes were being pulled and grabbed <br><br/>
My eyes found the face of my sister <br><br/>
And her eyes found dismay

She watched her treasured clothes <br><br/>
Rupture and tear and stretched away <br><br/>
She clutched my leg in fear <br><br/>
"Why?" she shouted, "why did they..."

Her tears ran down my jeans.

The white dress was torn and stamped <br><br/>
Dragged across the dirty muddy ground <br><br/>
The children ran back, up the soaked wooden stairs <br><br/>
And there was silence

The lady looked on, sadly <br><br/>
Father picked up my sister <br><br/>
We found ourselves back in the car <br><br/>
My sister curled up, bawling in my lap

"That is all they know, honey." <br><br/>
Father tried consoling her <br><br/>
"All their life they have snatched, <br><br/>
Stolen, robbed, everything."

Her sobs eventually stopped <br><br/>
"I understand," she said sadly <br><br/>
"I hope so, and if not today..." <br><br/>
Father paused.

"And if not today, I hope tomorrow."
