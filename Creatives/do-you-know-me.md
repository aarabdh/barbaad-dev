I see you <br><br/>
Sitting in your car <br><br/>
Glaring at the traffic lights <br><br/>
Loathing the red coloured light <br><br/>
All I own is a red cotton saree <br><br/>
Do you know me?

I see you <br><br/>
Sitting in the train <br><br/>
Waiting for your stop <br><br/>
Glancing at your watch every minute <br><br/>
I know the time by the blackness of my hand <br><br/>
Do you know me?

I see you <br><br/>
Sitting in your office <br><br/>
Typing on your computer <br><br/>
Shouting at your nervous inferiors <br><br/>
I shout in the streets asking for trash <br><br/>
Do you know me?

I see you <br><br/>
Marching in your rallies <br><br/>
Making clever posters <br><br/>
Demanding to be heard <br><br/>
I only ever demand to wake another day <br><br/>
Do you know me?
