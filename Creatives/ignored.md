He never really had a choice, he decided <br><br/>
Sitting on the decaying carpet <br><br/>
Looking at a crumbled ceiling <br><br/>
And looking at the stars through it

He had started a young lad, as all do <br><br/>
As is done to them still, <br><br/>
He had been dealt a hand <br><br/>
A hand only meant for taking

His life was monotonous <br><br/>
A single sentence written over and over <br><br/>
On a muddy parchment <br><br/>
Smeared through the years 

His job was to be unseen and nameless <br><br/>
Nodding and yessing for the farce <br><br/>
And whisking away the glasses. <br><br/>
Motions, mundane and thoughtless

And if his calloused hands cleaned <br><br/>
Another broken glass of wine <br><br/>
He paid it no mind, <br><br/>
And none was paid to him.
