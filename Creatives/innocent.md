Smoke blowing off his parched mouth <br><br/>
He clicked his tongue <br><br/>
And then asked me, <br><br/>
"Do you feel it?"

I simply stared at his impassive face <br><br/>
And then I turned <br><br/>
And looked at them, <br><br/>
The bodies around me.

Blood oozed and clogged the beach <br><br/>
Broken limbs scattered <br><br/>
Faces blown away, <br><br/>
"No," I replied.

His expression never changed any <br><br/>
The glint in his eyes <br><br/>
Shined with gritty reality <br><br/>
He asked, "Why?"

"You killed them, not me," I said. "Not me." <br><br/>
"True enough," he agreed. <br><br/>
"But I am a mercenary. <br><br/>
My job is to kill.

"You shook my hand with nary a whimper, <br><br/>
You pointed them out <br><br/>
And you never wavered. <br><br/>
Am I really the killer?"

"No, I'm innocent," was my desperate plea <br><br/>
And my eyes blurred <br><br/>
As I pulled the trigger <br><br/>
Of the gun in my hand.

My blood pooled around my heart <br><br/>
The gun billowed smoke <br><br/>
And it spun around <br><br/>
And dropped from my hand.
