I have two masks <br><br/>
Sometimes, they talk <br><br/>
One laughs as one cries, <br><br/>
And I just watch

One of them knows how to smile <br><br/>
It can recognize the jokes <br><br/>
And it knows not to frown <br><br/>
And it has never cried <br><br/>
Probably never will

The other doesn't know you <br><br/>
I don't think it knows me, too <br><br/>
It never seems to care about anything <br><br/>
It keeps staring out of my eyes <br><br/>
Looking at a gray world

They don't talk with words, <br><br/>
Or anything else tangible, really <br><br/>
They swirl into each other <br><br/>
And skitter through my skin <br><br/>
Often, I'm unsure which one is on my face <br><br/>
And which one in my mind.
