A stone's throw away from your home <br><br/>
Crossing a valley, toss of a mountain <br><br/>
You'll find him. Wearing too large shoes <br><br/>
On too little feet, walking on the mud <br><br/>
His hands hold not his dreams and delights <br><br/>
And nor does his feet carry the weight <br><br/>
Of untold mysteries, of unspoken promises <br><br/>
For he is not you.

No, his hands grope the rough pebbles and stones <br><br/>
And the lies of too many politicians <br><br/>
Pressing on his feet are dreams not his own <br><br/>
But those of the adults, the preachers <br><br/>
The liars, still <br><br/>
And so he walks on the stumbling road <br><br/>
Thinking his fall every other step <br><br/>
And when they ask him to, <br><br/>
He throws away his light and life <br><br/>
In the shape of small, tiny pebbles. <br><br/>
Later, they would be rocks, and bombs <br><br/>
As they grow older <br><br/>
Unlike him.
