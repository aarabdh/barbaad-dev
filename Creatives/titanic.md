'Twas the day I died, 'twas the day you lived <br><br/>
The unsinkable ship that sunk, the hopes and dreams <br><br/>
The captain who wouldn't abandon ship <br><br/>
The sorrowful choir that wouldn't cease <br><br/>
'Twas the day I died, 'twas the day you lived.

From wealth, wrapped in a façade you came <br><br/>
From heart, I came seeking shelter <br><br/>
The fates were merciless, the night dark <br><br/>
I could only save you, my heart <br><br/>
'Twas the day I died, 'twas the day you lived.

We loved, we danced, we sang, we laughed <br><br/>
We cried, we healed, we snuggled, we prayed <br><br/>
The alarms wailed in tandem, the people scared <br><br/>
We jumped into the sea, you and I, unafraid <br><br/>
'Twas the day I died, 'twas the day you lived.

The wood couldn't hold us both, the sea was cold <br><br/>
The ice was bitter, the ice was sweet <br><br/>
I couldn't let it hurt you, my queen <br><br/>
I floated beside you, alert, alive, but I couldn't hold <br><br/>
'Twas the day I loved, Rose, 'twas the day you loved.
