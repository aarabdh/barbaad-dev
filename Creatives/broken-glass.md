I live in a brothel <br><br/>
The reds and the low lights hide my shards <br><br/>
The blood that is spilt every night <br><br/>
If not in this room then the next

I come from the glass bangles <br><br/>
And sometimes from expensive wine bottles <br><br/>
Occasionally, from the broken mirror too <br><br/>
It really is easy to find me there

Hearing screams is quite common <br><br/>
Pleasure filled ones, not quite <br><br/>
Not one day passes by <br><br/>
Where I'm not held to the neck of a woman

I wasn't red, originally <br><br/>
But this place... There is so much red around <br><br/>
I have forgotten the other colours <br><br/>
And they have forgotten me

My shine has dried up, as have my eyes <br><br/>
But somedays, somedays... <br><br/>
I cry the red tears of those girls <br><br/>
As they bleed on my bed.
