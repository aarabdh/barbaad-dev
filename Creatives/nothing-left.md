Of course, you... who are you? <br><br/>
No I don't have any coins. <br><br/>
Get away from me <br><br/>
You're dirtier than this train

I have no idea, who you are <br><br/>
Are you even human? <br><br/>
Can you marry? Start a family? <br><br/>
Can you love?

Even as a child, even as I held you <br><br/>
I knew, you could never be like me <br><br/>
You are rare, precious, <br><br/>
A pearl in the sea of salt.

I couldn't keep you, what would they think? <br><br/>
They'll talk, you see? <br><br/>
Talk about you. And me. <br><br/>
I couldn't ignore their whispers.

I let them take you <br><br/>
To keep you safe, away, safely away. <br><br/>
To keep my future pure <br><br/>
And yours... Afraid.

So when, on the train, <br><br/>
I see you clap <br><br/>
I see you beg <br><br/>
I see you. <br><br/>
I look away.
