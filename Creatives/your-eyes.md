Interweaving through the smithereens <br><br/>
That once housed my heart <br><br/>
I came across your eyes <br><br/>
Hidden in the dark

Buried under the stone of regrets <br><br/>
And the sand of longing despair <br><br/>
My heart was lost <br><br/>
But here you remained

Your innocent, young, black eyes <br><br/>
Shining into our future <br><br/>
I cried when I saw you <br><br/>
Dead on the stretcher

Your face pale, your heart resting <br><br/>
Sighing only at noon <br><br/>
But then I saw your eyes <br><br/>
Defiantly glaring into the void

They gave me a strength, a purpose <br><br/>
An oath, to live against all odds <br><br/>
A sense of duty, responsibility <br><br/>
A shining sun through the clouds

So I persisted, I fought, and I lived <br><br/>
And looked, looked at your eyes <br><br/>
And when they looked at me <br><br/>
And called me "Mama!"

I cried. And I smiled.
