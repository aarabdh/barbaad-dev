If I had any children, I would tell them this <br><br/>
"Even if I don't remember you, <br><br/>
I love you."

Every day, I lose some pieces <br><br/>
Pieces of my world, pieces of the puzzle <br><br/>
They fall behind the dresser, <br><br/>
They hide under the bed

And everyday, it gets harder to find them

Every day, a girl comes to my house <br><br/>
She changes my clothes, cleans the dishes <br><br/>
And she lets me cry on her shoulders <br><br/>
She must be my daughter <br><br/>
At least that's what I choose to believe

Every day I wake up lonelier, <br><br/>
The sun is harsher on my eyes <br><br/>
The world is sharp, I don't wear glasses <br><br/>
It does make it harder for me though <br><br/>
When I don't recognize anything

What is this life, what am I? <br><br/>
Do memories not make a person? <br><br/>
Am I not alive? Am I not real? <br><br/>
Does everyone else exist? <br><br/>
Why do I keep breathing?
