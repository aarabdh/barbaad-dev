Everything we see is a fight <br><br/>
A battle of wills, every night <br><br/>
The lights flickering with the candles <br><br/>
The darkness swaying in the shadows

Reflections are the refrees in this game <br><br/>
Favouring none and all the same <br><br/>
The streets are lined with luminations <br><br/>
Hiding dreadfully silent Cimmerians

The moon watches in the heavens <br><br/>
As the candle shines and weakens <br><br/>
The shadow swells and swivels <br><br/>
With every breeze that travels

The critters silently turn and vanish <br><br/>
The predators keep hiding, famished <br><br/>
And never does ever the fire <br><br/>
Burn evermore brighter

The wax fails and the cat wails <br><br/>
As the candle's lusture curtails <br><br/>
The shadows creep ever closer <br><br/>
As man hides in his enclosure

When the candle looses its last <br><br/>
The shadows come hurrying fast <br><br/>
And when dismay seems high <br><br/>
Does the sun come lighting the sky

And so ends the game abstract <br><br/>
Of the mouse, and of the cat
